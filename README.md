# cuda_vec

Some minimal CUDA code to work with vectors (the linear algebra 3D type). I use it in the
simple OptiX-based VR rendering system that I have been putting together for experiments in our lab:

The code in both of these repositories is based off of Ingo Wald's excellent introduction to OptiX 7:

The vector code here is inspired by his GDT library:

I tried my best to learn, understand, and then re-build things from hand on my own. Hence, all errors are my own.

Best wishes,
